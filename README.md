# My-termux-zsh


I'm tired of Installing the whole Termux desktop and also tired of using multiple commands just to get zsh , auto complete , theme fonts , alias , motd and so on so i just created this


it's easy as duck, just run

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Worthiit/My-termux-zsh/main/Myzsh.sh)"
```
and boom , let it complete what it is doing 
you'll have my motd( welcome screen , it takes a bit time to load , sorry about it) and yeah simple zsh


it's my alt account and all repos are private so you won't have much to look here
