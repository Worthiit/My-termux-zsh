# My-termux-zsh

I'm tired of Installing the whole Termux desktop and also tired of using multiple commands just to get zsh , auto complete , theme fonts , alias , motd and so on so i just created this


it's easy as duck, just run

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Worthiit/My-termux-zsh/main/Myzsh.sh)"
```
and boom , let it complete what it is doing
